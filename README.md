Hello!
This is a side project I am doing to get more familiar with C++. The idea is that I want to be able to take a RISCV assmebly file and convert it into raw hex, and put it into an intel hex file.  The functionality is inspired by a class I took in Computer Architecture, that had a simulator and assembler that did the same thing. At time time that I took it (and TA'd it, the following semester), they used MIPS. Now they have moved onto RISCV (apparently translating the sim and assembler wasn't bad), but I still want to work on this as an exercise in a larger-scale project.

I attempted this project a year back, but failed due to poor planning and underestimating how much work the parser side of it was going to be. The code quality was poor, uncommented, and frankly the parser was brute-forced, slow, and inflexible. I've since discovered that I am not the type of person who can just jump into a project and code without prior planning. My most successful projects (both academically and professionally) have involved a few hours of careful planning. I'm going to leave the older attempt open as I believe it will be good too keep just to compare.
